# Forum for educational institutions

Forum for educational institutions where the students and teachers come together to learn and communicate with each other.

Eduforum is a platform for students to discuss their doubts with fellow students and faculty.

We have a homepage where the student and teacher and admin can choose as whom they want to login as.

A teacher can login and create subjects and also manage topics / posts under the subjects they created. They can allow or disallow the access to students for the subjects created by them. Teachers can mark the topics as closed and can also upvote and downvote posts.

Teachers create subjects, subjects contain topics (created by students/teachers), each topic can contain multiple posts. each post will contain the vote feature where the teacher or the student can upvote or downvote Students can login and can join a subject using the code assigned by the system admin or the teacher and create topics related to the subjects. He can add posts under topics in the subjects which he has joined. Students can also upvote and
downvote posts.

Admin creates student/teacher accounts, He can manage all the accounts in the forum.
